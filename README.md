This application is inspired by the flashcard application Anki. Anki is a randomized repeating flashcard application used to memorize information, and I wanted to replicate the experience with this app. Similar to Anki, one can create cards to study and study the cards. A similar algorithim to Anki was created in which cards must be answered correctly at least twice in a row in order to be complete with the card.

In the login page, there is an option to login with an existing account or to create an account for the application. Afterwards there is an option to start studying or to create cards. If you login, there will be some existing cards, but you can create your own in "Create Cards". Type in a question, answer, and choose a category.

When studing cards, you will receive a question. After you are done answering, you can press "Show Answer" to see if you were correct. Press correct or incorrect depending on whether you knew the answer. If you were correct, you will see the question another time to verify that you know it. If you got it incorrect, you will see the question at least two more times. By repeating the questions, the application improves memorization of the the questions. The questions are presented in a randomized fashion for better memorization.
